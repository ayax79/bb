    This package is scanned by stripes to pick up type converters and interceptors (and other extensions).

    This package should only contain items that should be included as stripes interceptors or override or define new
    type converters. If you want to define a new type converter that should not override an existing type converter
    place this type converter in the com.blackbox.presentation.util package.
