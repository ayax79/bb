					<h2>About Blackbox Republic</h2>

	<p><strong>What is BBR?</strong><br />
Blackbox Republic is a private, member-only place for people of all orientations and relationship combinations to meet and share their personal lives.</p>

	<p><strong>Who is BBR for?</strong><br />
Singles, couples or multiples who are open to people of all orientations, views on relationships, and lifestyles.</p>

	<h2>Friends and Followers</h2>

	<p><strong>What happens when I friend someone?</strong><br />
Friending is personal on Blackbox Republic.  When you friend someone, not only are you giving them access to your most personal level of activity on the site, but you&#8217;re sharing your real first and last name. Friend with care.  If you just want to connect with someone and keep abreast of their activity in your stream, follow them instead.  Save friending for real friends who you trust or, at minimum, people you&#8217;re ready to share personal information with who&#8217;ve been vouched by real friends you trust.</p>

	<p><strong>How do I add a friend to my friends list?</strong><br />
Visit their persona page and click &#8216;friend&#8217; at the top of the page, or click &#8216;friend&#8217; on their minipersona when you roll over their avatar anywhere on the site.</p>

	<p><strong>How do I follow someone?</strong><br />
Visit their persona page and click &#8216;follow at the top of the page, or click &#8216;follow on their minipersona when you roll over their avatar anywhere on the site.</p>

	<p><strong>What happens when I follow someone?</strong><br />
Their activity will appear in your &#8216;friends and followers&#8217; activity stream.  They&#8217;ll be part of your everyday world on BBR.</p>

	<p><strong>What&#8217;s the difference between a friend and a follower?</strong><br />
A follower is someone who sees your activity in their stream, but doesn&#8217;t have access to your friends-only activity or your real name. A friend is a trusted person to whom you&#8217;ve granted intimate access to your friends-only activity, photos and video. Friend with care.</p>

	<p><strong>What does it mean to wish someone?</strong> <br />
A wish is an expression of desire. When you wish a member, you&#8217;re telling them you&#8217;d like to get to know them better, perhaps see them at events&#8212;you generally wish to be closer to them. You can see a member&#8217;s wish status in their avatar. A white wishbone means that you&#8217;ve wished them, a grey wishbone means they&#8217;ve wished you, and a blue wishbone.</p>

	<p><strong>Someone&#8217;s bothering me, or I just don&#8217;t want to hear from them. Is there a way to block a member?</strong><br />
Yes indeed! Click &#8220;Donkey Kick&#8221; at the top of their persona page. This will remove them from your friends list (if you were already friends) and block them from sending you private messages. They will be able to see any public activity in your feed, but nothing that is restricted to friends.</p>

	<h2>Relationships</h2>

	<p><strong>How do I connect with my partner(s)?</strong><br />
First, friend them!  You must be friends before you can create an additional relationship. Now, click &#8220;Edit Relationships&#8221; beneath your sliders in your persona tab, then click &#8220;Add Relationship.&#8221;  Choose your partner from the userpicker, then enter the term that best describes your relationship.  There are no pulldowns, no checkboxes, no limits. I&#8217;m &#8220;blank&#8221; with &#8220;blank&#8221;.  It&#8217;s up to you.</p>

	<p><strong>Can I be linked to more than one partner?</strong><br />
Yes! You can list relationships with as many partners as you choose.  Relationships are flexible in Blackbox Republic; you are &#8220;blank&#8221; with &#8220;blank.&#8221; I&#8217;m in love with Mary, snuggling with John, buying a puppy with Sam.</p>

	<p><strong>Does the relationship I listed show up on my partner&#8217;s persona page?</strong><br />
Nope. You control your own persona page. Each of you can reflect your relationships in the way that makes sense to you.</p>

	<p><strong>How do I remove a relationship?</strong><br />
Click &#8220;Edit relationships&#8221; beneath your sliders in your persona tab, then click &#8220;Remove Relationship&#8221; next to the relationship.  Best of luck!</p>

	<h2>Billing</h2>

	<p><strong>How does the billing cycle work?</strong><br />
Access charges are billed monthly based on the date you sign up. Once you pay for your month, your access is immediately granted and your account will be open for a month. If you take no action, your account will be re-billed for another month on the same day of the following month (at the same level of membership). You don&#8217;t have to do anything for the re-bill to go through. It will use the same card information you used on signup.</p>

	<p><strong>How do I upgrade my account from limited to unlimited?</strong><br />
Contact Blackbox Republic Support to upgrade.  Your new billing cycle will start on the day of your credit card payment is processed, and the previous $5 membership will be applied to your first month.  </p>

	<p><strong>For &#8220;multiples&#8221; relationship, how does the billing work? Can I split it up?</strong><br />
Group memberships are purchased as a single unit that includes up to four members. Just like your relationship, it&#8217;s up to you how you manage the payment between you.</p>

	<h2>Privacy</h2>

	<p><strong>Is my information secure/kept private?</strong><br />
Yes. Passwords are encrypted, and members are vouched by other members. You can further protect your privacy on the site by choosing which members have access to your activity when you limit your posts to friends, members, or the public stream.</p>

	<p><strong>Where do the words come from in the activity cloud? Will words I use in my private conversations be picked up in the cloud?</strong><br />
The words in your activity cloud come from all of your activity on the site, including your messages. The more frequently you use a word, the more prominently it appears in your cloud. Less frequently used words fade away in time.</p>

	<p><strong>Can I keep my slider settings confidential?</strong><br />
You sure can! You can update any of your slider settings anytime things change! If you feel like keeping your sliders to yourself, just click the &#8220;private&#8221; checkbox right below them before saving. </p>

	<p><strong>What if I don&#8217;t want to be followed?</strong><br />
Followers will only see activity that&#8217;s made available to all members. Anyone can follow you; it&#8217;s like an RSS feed of public activity. However, your friends-only activity won&#8217;t be available to followers unless you choose to friend them.</p>

	<p><strong>Does the personal information I enter at registration show up in my persona?</strong><br />
No! Your date of birth is used to calculate your age but is not shared. Your email address is used for us to communicate with you but is never shared on the site. </p>

	<p><strong>Does my persona information appear in search engine results?</strong><br />
No way! All of your Blackbox Republic activity is contained within a secure system that isn't visible to search engines such as Google.</p>

	<h2>Photos</h2>

	<p><strong>How do I change my avatar pic?</strong><br />
Click &#8216;update pic&#8217; on your pretty face in your persona pic.  Choose a photo to upload from your hard drive. You&#8217;ll be prompted to crop and position it two times, once for use as your avatar and once as your persona pic.</p>

	<p><strong>How do I upload pictures to my photo album?</strong><br />
In your persona tab, click the &#8216;pictures&#8217; tab, then click &#8216;upload&#8217; in the lower righthand corner. You can either create an album or upload a just a single photo.</p>

	<p><strong>How do I delete pictures from my photo album?</strong><br />
Click &#8220;Posted to&#8220; beneath your photo, and you&#8217;ll see a delete checkbox immediately beneath the privacy options. Delete away!</p>

	<p><strong>Who sees my pictures?</strong><br />
When you upload your photo, you can choose to publish it privately (only you can see it), to friends, to all BBR members, or the world. When you choose to publish a photo to the world, it means you&#8217;re releasing it beyond the BBR community. It will appear on the BBR homepage, appear in Google search results.  Use &#8220;the world&#8221; carefully &mdash; it&#8217;s public!</p>

	<h2>Registration</h2>

	<p><strong>How do I register as a couple?</strong><br />
Choose unlimited membership ($25).  Unlimited membership permits up to 2 members under a single membership.</p>

	<p><strong>How do I register as a group?</strong><br />
Choose group membership ($45).  Group membership permits up to four members under a single membership.</p>

	<p><strong>If I&#8217;m registered as a couple/multiple/group but we don&#8217;t live together, how do I receive physical gifts?</strong><br />
Although your account is registered under the same credit card, each persona&#8217;s account information is managed separately. You&#8217;ll create and manage your persona individually, and your address information can be updated anytime under Account Settings, found in the top righthand corner of BBR, above your username.</p>
